I've followed the instructions on [[https://bitbucket.org/djpohly/dwm-patches/src][dwm patches]] then the instructions
on the README. I had to make a ~.hgrc 

Just changed the make line to run =make dwm= instead of
=make install= and copied resulting dwm library to ~/bin. Should have
symbolically linked it.

I have not even remembered to do "apt-get build-dep dwm" before
compiling, but it seems everything was already here.
